# Systematic Debugging

## Overview

Random fixes waste time and create new bugs. Quick patches mask underlying issues.

**Core principle:** ALWAYS find root cause before attempting fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

**Violating the letter of this process is violating the spirit of debugging.**

## The Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Phase 1, you cannot propose fixes.

## When to Use

Use for ANY technical issue:
- Test failures
- Bugs in production
- Unexpected behavior
- Performance problems
- Build failures
- Integration issues

**Use this ESPECIALLY when:**
- Under time pressure (emergencies make guessing tempting)
- "Just one quick fix" seems obvious
- You've already tried multiple fixes
- Previous fix didn't work
- You don't fully understand the issue

**Don't skip when:**
- Issue seems simple (simple bugs have root causes too)
- You're in a hurry (rushing guarantees rework)
- Manager wants it fixed NOW (systematic is faster than thrashing)

## The Four Phases

You MUST complete each phase before proceeding to the next. Full playbook — including the multi-component evidence-gathering template, data-flow tracing, and the 3+ failed-fixes → question-architecture escalation — lives in **`phases-reference.md`** in this directory. Load it when running an active debugging session.

1. **Root Cause Investigation** — Read errors, reproduce consistently, check recent changes, instrument component boundaries, trace data flow backward. Do not propose fixes until this phase is complete.
2. **Pattern Analysis** — Find working examples in the same codebase. Compare working vs. broken. List every difference. Understand dependencies.
3. **Hypothesis and Testing** — Form a single, specific hypothesis. Test with the smallest possible change. One variable at a time. If it fails, form a new hypothesis — do not stack fixes.
4. **Implementation** — Write a failing test case first. Implement a single targeted fix. Verify. If three fixes have failed, STOP and question the architecture before attempting a fourth.

## Red Flags — STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking:
- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "Add multiple changes, run tests"
- "Skip the test, I'll manually verify"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- "Pattern says X but I'll adapt it differently"
- "Here are the main problems: [lists fixes without investigation]"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- **"One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)**
- **Each fix reveals new problem in different place**

**ALL of these mean: STOP. Return to Phase 1.**

**If 3+ fixes failed:** Question the architecture (see Phase 4 step 5 in `phases-reference.md`).

## your human partner's Signals You're Doing It Wrong

**Watch for these redirections:**
- "Is that not happening?" — You assumed without verifying
- "Will it show us...?" — You should have added evidence gathering
- "Stop guessing" — You're proposing fixes without understanding
- "Ultrathink this" — Question fundamentals, not just symptoms
- "We're stuck?" (frustrated) — Your approach isn't working

**When you see these:** STOP. Return to Phase 1.

## Common Rationalizations

| Excuse | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| "Issue is simple, don't need process" | Simple issues have root causes too. Process is fast for simple bugs. |
| "Emergency, no time for process" | Systematic debugging is FASTER than guess-and-check thrashing. |
| "Just try this first, then investigate" | First fix sets the pattern. Do it right from the start. |
| "I'll write test after confirming fix works" | Untested fixes don't stick. Test first proves it. |
| "Multiple fixes at once saves time" | Can't isolate what worked. Causes new bugs. |
| "Reference too long, I'll adapt the pattern" | Partial understanding guarantees bugs. Read it completely. |
| "I see the problem, let me fix it" | Seeing symptoms ≠ understanding root cause. |
| "One more fix attempt" (after 2+ failures) | 3+ failures = architectural problem. Question pattern, don't fix again. |

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Key Activities | Success Criteria |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **1. Root Cause** | Read errors, reproduce, check changes, gather evidence | Understand WHAT and WHY |
| **2. Pattern** | Find working examples, compare | Identify differences |
| **3. Hypothesis** | Form theory, test minimally | Confirmed or new hypothesis |
| **4. Implementation** | Create test, fix, verify | Bug resolved, tests pass |

## When Process Reveals "No Root Cause"

If systematic investigation reveals issue is truly environmental, timing-dependent, or external:

1. You've completed the process
2. Document what you investigated
3. Implement appropriate handling (retry, timeout, error message)
4. Add monitoring/logging for future investigation

**But:** 95% of "no root cause" cases are incomplete investigation.

## Supporting Techniques

These techniques are part of systematic debugging and available in this directory:

- **`phases-reference.md`** — Full four-phase playbook with examples and escalation rules
- **`root-cause-tracing.md`** — Trace bugs backward through call stack to find original trigger
- **`defense-in-depth.md`** — Add validation at multiple layers after finding root cause
- **`condition-based-waiting.md`** — Replace arbitrary timeouts with condition polling

**Related skills:**
- **superpowers:test-driven-development** — For creating failing test case (Phase 4, Step 1)
- **superpowers:verification-before-completion** — Verify fix worked before claiming success

## Real-World Impact

From debugging sessions:
- Systematic approach: 15–30 minutes to fix
- Random fixes approach: 2–3 hours of thrashing
- First-time fix rate: 95% vs 40%
- New bugs introduced: Near zero vs common
